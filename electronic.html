<h2><strong><u>Assymetrical Fault Analysis</u></strong></h2>

<br>1. introduction
<br>2. LINE to ground fault
<br>3. Line to line fault
<br>4. Double line to ground fault
<br><br><br>


<p> Instructional Objective
<br>
On completion of this lesson a student should be able to:
<br>
<br>A. Develop sequence network connections for L-G L-L 2L-G faults
<br>B. Solve for fault current in case of L-G fault
<br>C. Solve for fault current in case of L-L fault
<br>D. Solve for fault current in case of 2L-G fault
</p>

<p><u>TYPES OF FAULTS</u>
<br>=====
<br>L-G
<br>L-L-L    -> Asymmetrical Faults
<br>L-L
<br>=====
<br>3phase-G -> Symmetrical Faults
<br>=====
<br>1p-open
<br>2p-open  ->  Asymmetrical Faults
<br>=====</p>
<p>
Asymmetrical Faults -> Unbalanced currents and voltages
<br>Single phase analysis -> Not possible ( 불평형이기때문에_)
<br>Three phase analysis -> Increased complexity(한상만하면되는게아니라 3상 모두 분석해야하기때문에)
<br>Network and euqipments -> Balanced three phase system except at the point of fault
<br>( designed to operate as a balanced three-phase system 일반적상황에서 항상 평형이다.
<br>so all the equipment are desined as a balanced three phase system)
<br>Transmission line -> symmetrical by using transposition
